            tracking count by setting 0 and adding +1 in each for loop run so in the end I can see how many groups the script has posted to and how long it took. 
            Interesting to track the duration to later see how minor changes in the code affects the time it takes for the script to complete. 
            Currently the average time for the script to post to one group is around 24 seconds. 
            Times that by 100 groups and you have 40 minutes that you can not do anything else with your computer. 
            If I manage to cut the those 24 seconds to 15 or so without any gliches (script stumbling over its own feet, because it goes too fast), then.. 
            yeah, better for me. Script finishes quickier.
